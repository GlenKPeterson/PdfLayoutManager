PdfLayoutManager
================
A page-layout manager for PDFBox to do things like line-breaking, page-breaking, and tables.
Uses a box-model for styles.
Requires PDFBox which in turn requires Log4J or apache commons Logging.

Usage Example
=============
The unit tests may be monolithic, but they provide a good usage example:

https://github.com/GlenKPeterson/PdfLayoutManager/blob/master/src/test/java/TestPdfLayoutMgr.java

Download / Maven Dependency
===========================

    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.planbase.pdf</groupId>
        <artifactId>PdfLayoutManager</artifactId>
        <version>0.3.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
    </dependency>

Actual files are here:
https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/com/planbase/pdf/PdfLayoutManager/0.2.2-SNAPSHOT/

Building from Source
====================
Requires Maven 3 and Java JDK 1.5 or greater (earliest verified JDK is: 1.6.0_45).  Jar file ends up in the `target/` sub-folder.

API documentation can be built with `mvn javadoc:javadoc` and is then found at `target/site/apidocs/index.html`

A sample PDF named `test.pdf` shows up in the root folder of this project when you run `mvn test`.

A jar file can be built with `mvn clean package` and ends up in the `target/` sub-folder.

Recent Changes
==============
**2015-03-14 Portrait Orientation**
***Version 0.3.0-SNAPSHOT***
Added Portrait page orientation (previously only Landscape was available).  Orientation applies to a LogicalPage
(a grouping of similar pages) so that you can switch mid-document.  Public methods were moved from PdfLayoutMgr to
LogicalPage in order for this to work: pageMgr(), yPageTop(), yPageBottom(), and pageWidth(). Now you must call
them *after* LogicalPage lp = pageMgr.logicalPageStart(); Also added some comments and fixed others.  Because this
changes the API, I bumped up the middle version number.  Thank you @EricHans76 for requesting this feature.

***Version 0.2.2***
Fixed misleading use of package-scoped method in the example/test.  Thank you @wienczny

Version 0.2.1: Built with JDK 1.6.0_45 to ensure backward compatibility (Maven 3 wouldn't run with 1.5.0_22).
Made a few classes private and updated the JavaDocs.  Thank you @peterdietz

Version 0.2: Added true table builder classes, a cascade of styles from Document to LogicalPage to Renderable/Cell/Table, etc.
Tables have Parts (which you probably will define as a head and body with appropriate styles and column widths).
TableParts have Rows, Rows have Cells.
Cells are also Renderable and available outside of Tables, analogous to the HTML box-model, but without "margins" only padding and borders.
Also added PNG image support.

Version 0.1.1: Added run-time check for appropriate data types used to create a Cell to provide fail-fast behavior for
client code - if you pass an invalid object type, it throws an exception immediately instead of waiting to purge the cache.

Version 0.1: Initial working and documented version

Intended API Changes
====================
Make the positive Y axis go down instead of up.  This will match how PDF files work and allow us to replace the XyOffset
class with XyDim.  One less class, one less perspective to worry about.  Also, this adds consistency to the API, thus
facilitating reuse.  When this happens, clients will have to redo 2-3 lines of code where they calculate page dimensions
and change `y +=` to `y -=`.

Be a little more careful about making things inside the PdfLayoutMgr class private.  Some older code in there is working
and needs a cleanup before this can happen.  If you follow the sample code in test/java/TestPdfLayoutMgr and don't
try accessing default/package-scoped methods, you should not need to make any changes.
