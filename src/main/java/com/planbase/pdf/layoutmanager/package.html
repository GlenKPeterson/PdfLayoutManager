<body><p>The layoutmanager package extends org.apache.PdfBox with tools for line-breaking,
page-breaking, tables, and styles.  It provides an abstraction that lets lines and shaded
backgrounds cross physical pages (vertically) to produce a larger logical page.  This allows text,
table cells, and images flow naturally from one page to the next.</p>

<p>Unlike the PDF spec and PDFBox, all measurements are specified in positive document units and all
positioning is specified from the top-left corner of the item being positioned.  Like PDFBox,
positive y-values are toward the top of the page, so you have to *decrement* y every time you move
down a line.</p>

<p>Items are given a Z-index internally to determine which overwrites which when there is overlap.  If
two items overlap and have the same Z-index, the last one specified overwrites the first (they are
simply rendered in order).</p>

<p>Classes representing page objects are designed to minimize mutability and side-effects, but
PdfLayoutMgr and the underlying PDFContentStream it acts upon are mutable, have side effects (they
write output), and are NOT thread-safe.</p>

<p>Start by looking at the unit test and the sample PDF it builds.
    Then PdfLayoutMgr is the class to start with to use the API yourself.</p></body>
